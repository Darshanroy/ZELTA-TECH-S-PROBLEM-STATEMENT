    "- `High:` This column represents the highest price that Bitcoin reached during the specified time period.\n",

    "### A risk management plan is a set of rules and procedures that are designed to help investors manage the risk of their investments. A risk management plan for the BTC/USDT market should include the following elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stop-loss rules:** Stop-loss rules are designed to automatically close a trade if the price of the asset moves against the investor. This can help to prevent the investor from losing more money than they can afford.\n",
    "* **Risk-reward ratios:** Risk-reward ratios are a measure of the potential return on an investment compared to the potential risk. Investors should only enter into trades with a positive risk-reward ratio.\n",
    "* **Position sizing:** Position sizing refers to the amount of money that an investor is willing to risk on a single trade. Investors should only risk a small percentage of their total portfolio on any one trade.\n",
    "* **Diversification:** Diversification is the practice of investing in a variety of different assets. This can help to reduce the risk of an investor losing money if one asset performs poorly.\n",

    "In addition to these elements, a risk management plan should also include a review process. This process should be used to regularly evaluate the plan and make any necessary adjustments.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Transaction Costs Formula:\n",
    "   - Transaction Cost = (Closing Price on Previous Day * Transaction Cost Rate) + (Closing Price on Current Day * Transaction Cost Rate)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Where:\n",
    "   - Closing Price on Previous Day: The closing price of the asset on the day before the trade.\n",
    "   - Closing Price on Current Day: The closing price of the asset on the day of the trade.\n",
    "   - Transaction Cost Rate: The rate charged per transaction, usually given as a percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Slippage Formula:\n",
    "   - Expected Closing Price = (High + Low) / 2\n",
    "   - Slippage = Expected Closing Price - Actual Closing Price\n",
    "\n",
    "   Where:\n",
    "   - High: The highest price of the asset during the trading period.\n",
    "   - Low: The lowest price of the asset during the trading period.\n",
    "   - Expected Closing Price: The average of the High and Low prices, representing the anticipated closing price.\n",
    "   - Actual Closing Price: The real closing price of the asset on the trading day.\n",
    "\n",
    "These formulas help compute transaction costs and slippage based on the provided data, enabling you to analyze the expenses and deviations in the actual execution of a trade. Adjust the variables accordingly with accurate data to compute precise transaction costs and slippage for specific trading scenarios."
