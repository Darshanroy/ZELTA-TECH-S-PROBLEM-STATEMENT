    "Certainly! Here are the formulas for calculating transaction costs and slippage:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Transaction Costs Formula:\n",
    "   - Transaction Cost = (Closing Price on Previous Day * Transaction Cost Rate) + (Closing Price on Current Day * Transaction Cost Rate)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Where:\n",
    "   - Closing Price on Previous Day: The closing price of the asset on the day before the trade.\n",
    "   - Closing Price on Current Day: The closing price of the asset on the day of the trade.\n",
    "   - Transaction Cost Rate: The rate charged per transaction, usually given as a percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Slippage Formula:\n",
    "   - Expected Closing Price = (High + Low) / 2\n",
    "   - Slippage = Expected Closing Price - Actual Closing Price\n",
    "\n",
    "   Where:\n",
    "   - High: The highest price of the asset during the trading period.\n",
    "   - Low: The lowest price of the asset during the trading period.\n",
    "   - Expected Closing Price: The average of the High and Low prices, representing the anticipated closing price.\n",
    "   - Actual Closing Price: The real closing price of the asset on the trading day.\n",
    "\n",
    "These formulas help compute transaction costs and slippage based on the provided data, enabling you to analyze the expenses and deviations in the actual execution of a trade. Adjust the variables accordingly with accurate data to compute precise transaction costs and slippage for specific trading scenarios."
