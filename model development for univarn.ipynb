    " The SARIMAX model is a time series model that is used to forecast future values of a time series. The model is an acronym for Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors.\n",

    "\n",
    "The SARIMAX model can be used to forecast future values of a time series by using the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The model is first fit to the historical data.\n",
    "* The model is then used to forecast future values of the time series.\n",
    "* The forecasts are then evaluated to assess their accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SARIMAX model is a powerful tool that can be used to forecast future values of a time series. The model is relatively easy to fit and can be used to forecast a wide variety of time series.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Autoregressive (AR)**: The AR component of the SARIMAX model models the relationship between the current value of the time series and its past values. The AR component is represented by the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "y_t = c + ∑ β_i y_t-i + ε_t\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* y_t is the current value of the time series\n",
    "* c is a constant\n",
    "* β_i is the coefficient of the ith past value of the time series\n",
    "* ε_t is the error term\n",
    "\n",
    "The AR component of the SARIMAX model can be used to capture the trend in the time series. The AR component can also be used to model the seasonality in the time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Integrated (I)**: The I component of the SARIMAX model models the trend in the time series. The I component is represented by the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "y_t = y_t-1 + ε_t\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* y_t is the current value of the time series\n",
    "* y_t-1 is the previous value of the time series\n",
    "* ε_t is the error term\n",
    "\n",
    "The I component of the SARIMAX model can be used to remove the trend from the time series. The I component can also be used to make the time series stationary.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Moving average (MA)**: The MA component of the SARIMAX model models the relationship between the current value of the time series and its past errors. The MA component is represented by the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "y_t = c + ∑ θ_i ε_t-i + ε_t\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* y_t is the current value of the time series\n",
    "* c is a constant\n",
    "* θ_i is the coefficient of the ith past error\n",
    "* ε_t is the error term\n",
    "\n",
    "The MA component of the SARIMAX model can be used to capture the seasonality in the time series. The MA component can also be used to model the noise in the time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Seasonal autoregressive (SAR)**: The SAR component of the SARIMAX model models the relationship between the current value of the time series and its past seasonal values. The SAR component is represented by the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "y_t = c + ∑ γ_i y_t-si + ε_t\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* y_t is the current value of the time series\n",
    "* c is a constant\n",
    "* γ_i is the coefficient of the ith past seasonal value of the time series\n",
    "* s is the seasonality of the time series\n",
    "* ε_t is the error term\n",
    "\n",
    "The SAR component of the SARIMAX model can be used to capture the seasonality in the time series. The SAR component can also be used to model the noise in the time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Exogenous regressors (X)**: The X component of the SARIMAX model allows for the inclusion of exogenous variables in the model. Exogenous variables are variables that are not part of the time series itself, but that can have an impact on the time series. For example, the X component could be used to include the weather in a model of daily temperatures.\n",
